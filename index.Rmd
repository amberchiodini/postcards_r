I am currently a part-time undergraduate student at Northwestern University and am majoring in Biological Sciences 👩🎓. I also work full-time as a research technician in a lab that studies electrophysiology in fish 🐟. I have been working in laboratory animal science and biomedical research since 2018 🐁🧪. I plan to continue my education after I graduate and become a data scientist 🌠.
